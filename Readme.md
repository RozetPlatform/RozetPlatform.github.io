# Abstract

Rozet is a distributed, self-growing, autonomous reputation network built on Ethereum. It provides selective crowdsourcing which powers a previously inaccessible class of applications such as fraudless online voting and consumer reviews, ICO fraud analysis, SEO manipulation detection, CAPTCHA-less human verification, spam filtering, and more.

Applications can query and contribute to the network using a suite of smart contracts that abstract the complexity of the blockchain. Its low overhead, security and ease of use unlock the long tail of reputation analysis, trustless transacting and fraud detection.


# The Platform

The platform allows applications to query a database of reputation information in exchange for a fee, which is autonomously redistributed by the network to its most valuable contributors. Reputation information is a representation and record of a relationship between two parties. 

The network exists on the Ethereum blockchain. It is immutable and transparent. It cannot expire, be tampered with by governments or silenced with money. It is made of pre-programmed customizable smart contracts known as "Badges" that abstract the complexity of the blockchain and make it as easy to use as email.
